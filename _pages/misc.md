## Historical migration of the neotropical songbird *Setophaga cerulea*

Neotropical migratory songbirds, such as those traveling between North and South America, face significant challenges due to climate change. Variations in climatic conditions impact resource availability, travel duration, and the synchronization of key life events, such as reproduction and migration. It is well known that migratory birds are sensitive to alterations in climatic conditions, and temperature plays a crucial role in shaping their migration patterns.

I utilized data collected from 1983 to 2021 to identify the migratory patterns of the cerulean warbler (*Setophaga cerulea*), classified as ‘near threatened’ according to the IUCN Red List of endangered species. This species, breeding in North America and wintering in South America, is affected by adverse climatic conditions and habitat loss.

I created an animation using geospatial visualization techniques to depict the monthly distribution of *S. cerulea* in relation to historical maximum monthly temperature.

Long-term monitoring of *S. cerulea*, coupled with the analysis of climatic variables, provides valuable insights to guide the development of effective conservation strategies and management of critical habitats.

## Designing ecological corridor networks for the conservation of *Pteronura brasiliensis* in the Colombian Orinoquia region

The giant otter (*Pteronura brasiliensis*) is an endangered species found in aquatic habitats of South America, including the Colombian Orinoquia region. This region harbours rich biodiversity and is the habitat of several emblematic species, including *P. brasiliensis*. However, human activities such as the conversion of aquatic and riparian habitats into areas primarily dedicated to agriculture and grazing have reduced habitat availability. Water pollution also negatively affects water quality, potentially impacting food availability. Poaching for its fur and meat has also significantly contributed to population declines in some areas.

Giant otters are agile predators that consume a variety of fish, crustaceans, and other aquatic organisms. In areas where food resources are scarce or have declined due to overfishing or other factors, *P. brasiliensis* may directly compete with local inhabitants for the same resources. Furthermore, habitat fragmentation can lead to the loss of genetic diversity and population isolation, disrupting species dispersal patterns by creating physical barriers that hinder their movement. This can impede colonization of new areas or the search for more suitable habitats in response to environmental changes caused by climate change.

These threats pose a challenge to the survival of the giant otter and other species in the region. The giant otter is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. In this context, the design of ecological corridor networks emerges as a tool to mitigate the negative effects of habitat fragmentation and promote landscape connectivity, facilitating the movement of the species between protected areas and key habitats, thereby promoting its long-term survival.

Due to their dependence on healthy aquatic habitats and riparian forest areas for survival, it is crucial to identify and protect watercourses that are essential for giant otters. In this regard, I collected data on the historical distribution of *P. brasiliensis*, as well as on protected areas, watercourses, land cover, and slopes that may act as natural barriers to movement. Additionally, I considered human settlements, including roads, urban areas, and dwellings, which could pose anthropogenic barriers to movement. I utilized a species distribution model to estimate the likelihood of *P. brasiliensis* presence in the area. Using remote sensing tools and GIS, I conducted a spatial analysis to identify key areas where the installation of wildlife crossings could enhance connectivity between giant otter habitats. This analysis involved assessing ecological viability, movement resistances, and potential connectivity of different sites. Furthermore, land cover scenarios were employed to identify how the landscape may influence giant otter connectivity in the area.

The design of ecological corridor networks presents a strategy to enhance habitat connectivity and facilitate the movement of *P. brasiliensis* in a zone of the Colombian Orinoquia region. However, ongoing collaboration among diverse stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and local communities, is necessary to properly implement and monitor these corridors, thus ensuring the long-term conservation of this species and its habitat.
