As a biologist, my research encompasses the development and application of models, as well as geospatial analyses in ecology, utilizing methodological approaches that integrate software such as GIS and R. My primary interests include identifying spatial patterns in species distribution, developing biological corridors, and understanding host specificity of epiphytic plants in fragmented habitats. Through statistical and geospatial analyses, I aim to uncover patterns and relationships within complex natural systems across diverse contexts.
