## Biography

I am a postdoctoral researcher in statistics at the <a href="https://www.creem.st-andrews.ac.uk/">Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling</a> (CREEM) of the University of St Andrews, UK, where I started in February 2019. I am working on continuous-time models of animal movement and behaviour.

Between 2016 and 2018, I did a PhD at the School of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of Sheffield, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.paul-blackwell.staff.shef.ac.uk/index.html">Paul Blackwell</a>. I worked on the integration of animal movement, space use, and habitat selection across spatio-temporal scales. My thesis is available online: [_Stochastic models of animal movement and habitat selection_](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/23688/1/TheoMichelot_PhD_thesis_April2019.pdf).

In 2015, I graduated from the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_national_des_sciences_appliqu%C3%A9es">Institut National des Sciences Appliqu&eacute;es</a></i> of Rouen, in France, where I studied <a href="https://www.insa-rouen.fr/formation/specialites-ingenieurses/genie-mathematique/programme-de-la-specialite-genie-mathematique">mathematics and computer science</a>. In 2013 and 2015, I spent some time at CREEM, and I worked with <a href="http://rolandlangrock.com/">Roland Langrock</a> on the modelling of ecological data with hidden Markov models. I am also part of the group <a href="http://ecohmm.wixsite.com/ecohmm">EcoHMM</a>, which brings together researchers working on various ecological applications of hidden Markov models.

I have been lucky to collaborate with people from various countries on many different ecological data sets. The map below shows some of the study species I have worked on in the last few years. For references, see my [publications page](https://theomichelot.github.io/publications/).
